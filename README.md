## Introduction  
Football Management (FM) is a football database management system designed to handle various data regarding teams and players associated with a league.  

This project was developed as part of our course requirement. This one was relatively easier to develop compared to my other project, [Centralized Club Operations](https://github.com/wolverton120/centralized-club-operations), which was being developed at the same time—mostly because this app was a demonstration of using SQL to handle database management (hence why it uses SQLite) and stores all the data internally.  

## How to use?  
You can either clone the repo in Android Studio by going to **File → New → Project from Version Control** → copy and paste the repo URL or [**download the pre-built app from here**.](https://github.com/wolverton120/football-management/releases/tag/10-2-25) You’ll need an Android device to run the app.  

## Disclaimer  
As mentioned previously, this app does not incorporate an online database, and hence all the data inserted is stored internally on the user’s device.
